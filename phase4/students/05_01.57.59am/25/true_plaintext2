how heavy do i journey on the way
when what i seek my weary travels end
doth teach that case and that repose to say
thus far the miles are measured from thy friend
the beast that bears me tired with my woe
plods dully on to bear that weight in me
as if by some instinct the wretch did know
his rider loved not speed being made from thee
the bloody spur cannot provoke him on
that sometimes anger thrusts into his hide
which heavily he answers with a groan
more sharp to me than spurring to his side
  for that same groan doth put this in my mind
  my grief lies onward and my joy behind

aawoo

                    10

For shame deny that thou bearst love to any
Who for thy self art so unprovident
Grant if thou wilt thou art beloved of many
But that thou none lovst is most evident
For thou art so possessed with murdrous hate
That gainst thy self thou stickst not to conspire
Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate
Which to repair should be thy chief desire
O change thy thought that I may change my mind
Shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love
Be as thy presence is gracious and kind
Or to thy self at least kindhearted prove
  Make thee another self for love of me
  That beauty still may live in thine or thee

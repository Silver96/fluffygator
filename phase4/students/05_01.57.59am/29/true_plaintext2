sweet love renew thy force be it not said
thy edge should blunter be than appetite
which but today by feeding is allayed
tomorrow sharpened in his former might
so love be thou although today thou fill
thy hungry eyes even till they wink with fulness
tomorrow see again and do not kill
the spirit of love with a perpetual dulness
let this sad interim like the ocean be
which parts the shore where two contracted new
come daily to the banks that when they see
return of love more blest may be the view
  or call it winter which being full of care
  makes summers welcome thrice more wished more rare

o how much more doth beauty beauteous seem
by that sweet ornament which truth doth give
the rose looks fair but fairer we it deem
for that sweet odour which doth in it live
the canker blooms have full as deep a dye
as the perfumed tincture of the roses
hang on such thorns and play as wantonly
when summers breath their masked buds discloses
but for their virtue only is their show
they live unwooed and unrespected fade
die to themselves sweet roses do not so
of their sweet deaths are sweetest odours made
  and so of you beauteous and lovely youth
  when that shall fade my verse distills your truth

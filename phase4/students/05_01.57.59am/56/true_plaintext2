who will believe my verse in time to come
if it were filled with your most high deserts
though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb
which hides your life and shows not half your parts
if i could write the beauty of your eyes
and in fresh numbers number all your graces
the age to come would say this poet lies
such heavenly touches neer touched earthly faces
so should my papers yellowed with their age
be scorned like old men of less truth than tongue
and your true rights be termed a poets rage
and stretched metre of an antique song
  but were some child of yours alive that time
  you should live twice in it and in my rhyme

not marble nor the gilded monuments
of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme
but you shall shine more bright in these contents
than unswept stone besmeared with sluttish time
when wasteful war shall statues overturn
and broils root out the work of masonry
nor mars his sword nor wars quick fire shall burn
the living record of your memory
gainst death and alloblivious enmity
shall you pace forth your praise shall still find room
even in the eyes of all posterity
that wear this world out to the ending doom
  so till the judgment that your self arise
  you live in this and dwell in lovers eyes

cequinta

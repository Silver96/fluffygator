as a decrepit father takes delight
to see his active child do deeds of youth
so i made lame by fortunes dearest spite
take all my comfort of thy worth and truth
for whether beauty birth or wealth or wit
or any of these all or all or more
entitled in thy parts do crowned sit
i make my love engrafted to this store
so then i am not lame poor nor despised
whilst that this shadow doth such substance give
that i in thy abundance am sufficed
and by a part of all thy glory live
  look what is best that best i wish in thee
  this wish i have then ten times happy me

sin of selflove possesseth all mine eye
and all my soul and all my every part
and for this sin there is no remedy
it is so grounded inward in my heart
methinks no face so gracious is as mine
no shape so true no truth of such account
and for my self mine own worth do define
as i all other in all worths surmount
but when my glass shows me my self indeed
beated and chopt with tanned antiquity
mine own selflove quite contrary i read
self so selfloving were iniquity
  tis thee my self that for my self i praise
  painting my age with beauty of thy days

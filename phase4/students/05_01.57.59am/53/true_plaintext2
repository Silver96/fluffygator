how careful was i when i took my way
each trifle under truest bars to thrust
that to my use it might unused stay
from hands of falsehood in sure wards of trust
but thou to whom my jewels trifles are
most worthy comfort now my greatest grief
thou best of dearest and mine only care
art left the prey of every vulgar thief
thee have i not locked up in any chest
save where thou art not though i feel thou art
within the gentle closure of my breast
from whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part
  and even thence thou wilt be stoln i fear
  for truth proves thievish for a prise so dear

so am i as the rich whose blessed key
can bring him to his sweet uplocked treasure
the which he will not every hour survey
for blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure
therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare
since seldom coming in that long year set
like stones of worth they thinly placed are
or captain jewels in the carcanet
so is the time that keeps you as my chest
or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide
to make some special instant specialblest
by new unfolding his imprisoned pride
  blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope
  being had to triumph being lacked to hope

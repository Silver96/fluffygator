thus can my love excuse the slow offence
of my dull bearer when from thee i speed
from where thou art why should i haste me thence
till i return of posting is no need
o what excuse will my poor beast then find
when swift extremity can seem but slow
then should i spur though mounted on the wind
in winged speed no motion shall i know
then can no horse with my desire keep pace
therefore desire of perfectst love being made
shall neigh no dull flesh in his fiery race
but love for love thus shall excuse my jade
  since from thee going he went wilfulslow
  towards thee ill run and give him leave to go

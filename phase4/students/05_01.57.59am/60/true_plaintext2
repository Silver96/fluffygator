music to hear why hearst thou music sadly
sweets with sweets war not joy delights in joy
why lovst thou that which thou receivst not gladly
or else receivst with pleasure thine annoy
if the true concord of welltuned sounds
by unions married do offend thine ear
they do but sweetly chide thee who confounds
in singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear
mark how one string sweet husband to another
strikes each in each by mutual ordering
resembling sire and child and happy mother
who all in one one pleasing note do sing
  whose speechless song being many seeming one
  sings this to thee thou single wilt prove none

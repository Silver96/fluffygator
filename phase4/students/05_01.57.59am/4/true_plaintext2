lo in the orient when the gracious light
lifts up his burning head each under eye
doth homage to his newappearing sight
serving with looks his sacred majesty
and having climbed the steepup heavenly hill
resembling strong youth in his middle age
yet mortal looks adore his beauty still
attending on his golden pilgrimage
but when from highmost pitch with weary car
like feeble age he reeleth from the day
the eyes fore duteous now converted are
from his low tract and look another way
  so thou thy self outgoing in thy noon
  unlooked on diest unless thou get a son

the other two slight air and purging fire
are both with thee wherever i abide
the first my thought the other my desire
these presentabsent with swift motion slide
for when these quicker elements are gone
in tender embassy of love to thee
my life being made of four with two alone
sinks down to death oppressed with melancholy
until lifes composition be recured
by those swift messengers returned from thee
who even but now come back again assured
of thy fair health recounting it to me
  this told i joy but then no longer glad
  i send them back again and straight grow sad

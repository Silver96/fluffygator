those hours that with gentle work did frame
the lovely gase where every eye doth dwell
will play the tyrants to the very same
and that unfair which fairly doth excel
for neverresting time leads summer on
to hideous winter and confounds him there
sap checked with frost and lusty leaves quite gone
beauty oersnowed and bareness every where
then were not summers distillation left
a liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass
beautys effect with beauty were bereft
nor it nor no remembrance what it was
  but flowers distilled though they with winter meet
  leese but their show their substance still lives sweet

So is it not with me as with that muse
Stirred by a painted beauty to his verse
Who heaven it self for ornament doth use
And every fair with his fair doth rehearse
Making a couplement of proud compare
With sun and moon with earth and seas rich gems
With Aprils firstborn flowers and all things rare
That heavens air in this huge rondure hems
O let me true in love but truly write
And then believe me my love is as fair
As any mothers child though not so bright
As those gold candles fixed in heavens air
  Let them say more that like of hearsay well
  I will not praise that purpose not to sell

ceneri

full many a glorious morning have i seen
flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye
kissing with golden face the meadows green
gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy
anon permit the basest clouds to ride
with ugly rack on his celestial face
and from the forlorn world his visage hide
stealing unseen to west with this disgrace
even so my sun one early morn did shine
with all triumphant splendour on my brow
but out alack he was but one hour mine
the region cloud hath masked him from me now
  yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth
  suns of the world may stain when heavens sun staineth

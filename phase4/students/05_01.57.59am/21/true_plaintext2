when to the sessions of sweet silent thought
i summon up remembrance of things past
i sigh the lack of many a thing i sought
and with old woes new wail my dear times waste
then can i drown an eye unused to flow
for precious friends hid in deaths dateless night
and weep afresh loves long since cancelled woe
and moan th expense of many a vanished sight
then can i grieve at grievances foregone
and heavily from woe to woe tell oer
the sad account of forebemoaned moan
which i new pay as if not paid before
  but if the while i think on thee dear friend
  all losses are restored and sorrows end

that god forbid that made me first your slave
i should in thought control your times of pleasure
or at your hand th account of hours to crave
being your vassal bound to stay your leisure
o let me suffer being at your beck
th imprisoned absence of your liberty
and patience tame to sufferance bide each check
without accusing you of injury
be where you list your charter is so strong
that you your self may privilage your time
to what you will to you it doth belong
your self to pardon of selfdoing crime
  i am to wait though waiting so be hell
  not blame your pleasure be it ill or well

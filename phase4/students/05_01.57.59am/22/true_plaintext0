If thou survive my wellcontented day
When that churl death my bones with dust shall cover
And shalt by fortune once more resurvey
These poor rude lines of thy deceased lover
Compare them with the bettring of the time
And though they be outstripped by every pen
Reserve them for my love not for their rhyme
Exceeded by the height of happier men
O then vouchsafe me but this loving thought
Had my friends Muse grown with this growing age
A dearer birth than this his love had brought
To march in ranks of better equipage
  But since he died and poets better prove
  Theirs for their style Ill read his for his love

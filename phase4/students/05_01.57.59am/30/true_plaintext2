let those who are in favour with their stars
of public honour and proud titles boast
whilst i whom fortune of such triumph bars
unlooked for joy in that i honour most
great princes favourites their fair leaves spread
but as the marigold at the suns eye
and in themselves their pride lies buried
for at a frown they in their glory die
the painful warrior famoused for fight
after a thousand victories once foiled
is from the book of honour rased quite
and all the rest forgot for which he toiled
  then happy i that love and am beloved
  where i may not remove nor be removed

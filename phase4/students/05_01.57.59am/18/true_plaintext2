o that you were your self but love you are
no longer yours than you your self here live
against this coming end you should prepare
and your sweet semblance to some other give
so should that beauty which you hold in lease
find no determination then you were
your self again after your selfs decease
when your sweet issue your sweet form should bear
who lets so fair a house fall to decay
which husbandry in honour might uphold
against the stormy gusts of winters day
and barren rage of deaths eternal cold
  o none but unthrifts dear my love you know
  you had a father let your son say so

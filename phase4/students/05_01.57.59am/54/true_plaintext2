that thou hast her it is not all my grief
and yet it may be said i loved her dearly
that she hath thee is of my wailing chief
a loss in love that touches me more nearly
loving offenders thus i will excuse ye
thou dost love her because thou knowst i love her
and for my sake even so doth she abuse me
suffring my friend for my sake to approve her
if i lose thee my loss is my loves gain
and losing her my friend hath found that loss
both find each other and i lose both twain
and both for my sake lay on me this cross
  but heres the joy my friend and i are one
  sweet flattery then she loves but me alone

against that time if ever that time come
when i shall see thee frown on my defects
when as thy love hath cast his utmost sum
called to that audit by advised respects
against that time when thou shalt strangely pass
and scarcely greet me with that sun thine eye
when love converted from the thing it was
shall reasons find of settled gravity
against that time do i ensconce me here
within the knowledge of mine own desert
and this my hand against my self uprear
to guard the lawful reasons on thy part
  to leave poor me thou hast the strength of laws
  since why to love i can allege no cause

lord of my love to whom in vassalage
thy merit hath my duty strongly knit
to thee i send this written embassage
to witness duty not to show my wit
duty so great which wit so poor as mine
may make seem bare in wanting words to show it
but that i hope some good conceit of thine
in thy souls thought all naked will bestow it
till whatsoever star that guides my moving
points on me graciously with fair aspect
and puts apparel on my tattered loving
to show me worthy of thy sweet respect
  then may i dare to boast how i do love thee
  till then not show my head where thou mayst prove me

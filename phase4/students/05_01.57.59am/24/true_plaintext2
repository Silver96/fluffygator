is it for fear to wet a widows eye
that thou consumst thy self in single life
ah if thou issueless shalt hap to die
the world will wail thee like a makeless wife
the world will be thy widow and still weep
that thou no form of thee hast left behind
when every private widow well may keep
by childrens eyes her husbands shape in mind
look what an unthrift in the world doth spend
shifts but his place for still the world enjoys it
but beautys waste hath in the world an end
and kept unused the user so destroys it
  no love toward others in that bosom sits
  that on himself such murdrous shame commits

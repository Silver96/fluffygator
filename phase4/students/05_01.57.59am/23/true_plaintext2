why didst thou promise such a beauteous day
and make me travel forth without my cloak
to let base clouds oertake me in my way
hiding thy bravry in their rotten smoke
tis not enough that through the cloud thou break
to dry the rain on my stormbeaten face
for no man well of such a salve can speak
that heals the wound and cures not the disgrace
nor can thy shame give physic to my grief
though thou repent yet i have still the loss
th offenders sorrow lends but weak relief
to him that bears the strong offences cross
  ah but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds
  and they are rich and ransom all ill deeds

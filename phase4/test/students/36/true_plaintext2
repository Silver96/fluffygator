being your slave what should i do but tend
upon the hours and times of your desire
i have no precious time at all to spend
nor services to do till you require
nor dare i chide the worldwithoutend hour
whilst i my sovereign watch the clock for you
nor think the bitterness of absence sour
when you have bid your servant once adieu
nor dare i question with my jealous thought
where you may be or your affairs suppose
but like a sad slave stay and think of nought
save where you are how happy you make those
  so true a fool is love that in your will
  though you do any thing he thinks no ill

sdknight

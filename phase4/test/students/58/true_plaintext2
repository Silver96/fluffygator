how can my muse want subject to invent
while thou dost breathe that pourst into my verse
thine own sweet argument too excellent
for every vulgar paper to rehearse
o give thy self the thanks if aught in me
worthy perusal stand against thy sight
for whos so dumb that cannot write to thee
when thou thy self dost give invention light
be thou the tenth muse ten times more in worth
than those old nine which rhymers invocate
and he that calls on thee let him bring forth
eternal numbers to outlive long date
  if my slight muse do please these curious days
  the pain be mine but thine shall be the praise

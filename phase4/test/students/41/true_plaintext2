not from the stars do i my judgement pluck
and yet methinks i have astronomy
but not to tell of good or evil luck
of plagues of dearths or seasons quality
nor can i fortune to brief minutes tell
pointing to each his thunder rain and wind
or say with princes if it shall go well
by oft predict that i in heaven find
but from thine eyes my knowledge i derive
and constant stars in them i read such art
as truth and beauty shall together thrive
if from thy self to store thou wouldst convert
  or else of thee this i prognosticate
  thy end is truths and beautys doom and date

tired with all these for restful death i cry
as to behold desert a beggar born
and needy nothing trimmed in jollity
and purest faith unhappily forsworn
and gilded honour shamefully misplaced
and maiden virtue rudely strumpeted
and right perfection wrongfully disgraced
and strength by limping sway disabled
and art made tonguetied by authority
and folly doctorlike controlling skill
and simple truth miscalled simplicity
and captive good attending captain ill
  tired with all these from these would i be gone
  save that to die i leave my love alone

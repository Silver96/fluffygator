                    22

my glass shall not persuade me i am old
so long as youth and thou are of one date
but when in thee times furrows i behold
then look i death my days should expiate
for all that beauty that doth cover thee
is but the seemly raiment of my heart
which in thy breast doth live as thine in me
how can i then be elder than thou art
o therefore love be of thyself so wary
as i not for my self but for thee will
bearing thy heart which i will keep so chary
as tender nurse her babe from faring ill
  presume not on thy heart when mine is slain
  thou gavst me thine not to give back again

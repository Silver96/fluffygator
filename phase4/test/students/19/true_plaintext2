betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took
and each doth good turns now unto the other
when that mine eye is famished for a look
or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother
with my loves picture then my eye doth feast
and to the painted banquet bids my heart
another time mine eye is my hearts guest
and in his thoughts of love doth share a part
so either by thy picture or my love
thy self away art present still with me
for thou not farther than my thoughts canst move
and i am still with them and they with thee
  or if they sleep thy picture in my sight
  awakes my heart to hearts and eyes delight

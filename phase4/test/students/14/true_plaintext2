                    31

thy bosom is endeared with all hearts
which i by lacking have supposed dead
and there reigns love and all loves loving parts
and all those friends which i thought buried
how many a holy and obsequious tear
hath dear religious love stoln from mine eye
as interest of the dead which now appear
but things removed that hidden in thee lie
thou art the grave where buried love doth live
hung with the trophies of my lovers gone
who all their parts of me to thee did give
that due of many now is thine alone
  their images i loved i view in thee
  and thou all they hast all the all of me

How can I then return in happy plight
That am debarred the benefit of rest
When days oppression is not eased by night
But day by night and night by day oppressed
And each though enemies to eithers reign
Do in consent shake hands to torture me
The one by toil the other to complain
How far I toil still farther off from thee
I tell the day to please him thou art bright
And dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven
So flatter I the swartcomplexioned night
When sparkling stars twire not thou gildst the even
  But day doth daily draw my sorrows longer
  And night doth nightly make griefs length seem stronger

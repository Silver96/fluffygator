                    27

weary with toil i haste me to my bed
the dear respose for limbs with travel tired
but then begins a journey in my head
to work my mind when bodys works expired
for then my thoughts from far where i abide
intend a sealous pilgrimage to thee
and keep my drooping eyelids open wide
looking on darkness which the blind do see
save that my souls imaginary sight
presents thy shadow to my sightless view
which like a jewel hung in ghastly night
makes black night beauteous and her old face new
  lo thus by day my limbs by night my mind
  for thee and for my self no quiet find

ebernals

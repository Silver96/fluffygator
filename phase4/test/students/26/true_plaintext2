o how thy worth with manners may i sing
when thou art all the better part of me
what can mine own praise to mine own self bring
and what ist but mine own when i praise thee
even for this let us divided live
and our dear love lose name of single one
that by this separation i may give
that due to thee which thou deservst alone
o absence what a torment wouldst thou prove
were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave
to entertain the time with thoughts of love
which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive
  and that thou teachest how to make one twain
  by praising him here who doth hence remain

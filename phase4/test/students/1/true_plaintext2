                    11

as fast as thou shalt wane so fast thou growst
in one of thine from that which thou departest
and that fresh blood which youngly thou bestowst
thou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest
herein lives wisdom beauty and increase
without this folly age and cold decay
if all were minded so the times should cease
and threescore year would make the world away
let those whom nature hath not made for store
harsh featureless and rude barrenly perish
look whom she best endowed she gave thee more
which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish
  she carved thee for her seal and meant thereby
  thou shouldst print more not let that copy die

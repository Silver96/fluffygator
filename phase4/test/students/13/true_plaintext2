take all my loves my love yea take them all
what hast thou then more than thou hadst before
no love my love that thou mayst true love call
all mine was thine before thou hadst this more
then if for my love thou my love receivest
i cannot blame thee for my love thou usest
but yet be blamed if thou thy self deceivest
by wilful taste of what thy self refusest
i do forgive thy robbery gentle thief
although thou steal thee all my poverty
and yet love knows it is a greater grief
to bear greater wrong than hates known injury
  lascivious grace in whom all ill well shows
  kill me with spites yet we must not be foes

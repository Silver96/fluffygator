those pretty wrongs that liberty commits
when i am sometime absent from thy heart
thy beauty and thy years full well befits
for still temptation follows where thou art
gentle thou art and therefore to be won
beauteous thou art therefore to be assailed
and when a woman woos what womans son
will sourly leave her till he have prevailed
ay me but yet thou mightst my seat forbear
and chide thy beauty and thy straying youth
who lead thee in their riot even there
where thou art forced to break a twofold truth
  hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee
  thine by thy beauty being false to me

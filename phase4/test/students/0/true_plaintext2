is it thy will thy image should keep open
my heavy eyelids to the weary night
dost thou desire my slumbers should be broken
while shadows like to thee do mock my sight
is it thy spirit that thou sendst from thee
so far from home into my deeds to pry
to find out shames and idle hours in me
the scope and tenure of thy jealousy
o no thy love though much is not so great
it is my love that keeps mine eye awake
mine own true love that doth my rest defeat
to play the watchman ever for thy sake
  for thee watch i whilst thou dost wake elsewhere
  from me far off with others all too near

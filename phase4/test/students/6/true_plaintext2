mine eye hath played the painter and hath stelled
thy beautys form in table of my heart
my body is the frame wherein tis held
and perspective it is best painters art
for through the painter must you see his skill
to find where your true image pictured lies
which in my bosoms shop is hanging still
that hath his windows glased with thine eyes
now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done
mine eyes have drawn thy shape and thine for me
are windows to my breast wherethrough the sun
delights to peep to gase therein on thee
  yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art
  they draw but what they see know not the heart

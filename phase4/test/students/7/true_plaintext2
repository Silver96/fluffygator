a womans face with natures own hand painted
hast thou the master mistress of my passion
a womans gentle heart but not acquainted
with shifting change as is false womens fashion
an eye more bright than theirs less false in rolling
gilding the object whereupon it gaseth
a man in hue all hues in his controlling
which steals mens eyes and womens souls amaseth
and for a woman wert thou first created
till nature as she wrought thee fell adoting
and by addition me of thee defeated
by adding one thing to my purpose nothing
  but since she pricked thee out for womens pleasure
  mine be thy love and thy loves use their treasure

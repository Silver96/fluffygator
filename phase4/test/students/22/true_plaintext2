then let not winters ragged hand deface
in thee thy summer ere thou be distilled
make sweet some vial treasure thou some place
with beautys treasure ere it be selfkilled
that use is not forbidden usury
which happies those that pay the willing loan
thats for thy self to breed another thee
or ten times happier be it ten for one
ten times thy self were happier than thou art
if ten of thine ten times refigured thee
then what could death do if thou shouldst depart
leaving thee living in posterity
  be not selfwilled for thou art much too fair
  to be deaths conquest and make worms thine heir

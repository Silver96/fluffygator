against my love shall be as i am now
with times injurious hand crushed and oerworn
when hours have drained his blood and filled his brow
with lines and wrinkles when his youthful morn
hath travelled on to ages steepy night
and all those beauties whereof now hes king
are vanishing or vanished out of sight
stealing away the treasure of his spring
for such a time do i now fortify
against confounding ages cruel knife
that he shall never cut from memory
my sweet loves beauty though my lovers life
  his beauty shall in these black lines be seen
  and they shall live and he in them still green

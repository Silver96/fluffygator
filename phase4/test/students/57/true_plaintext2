when forty winters shall besiege thy brow
and dig deep trenches in thy beautys field
thy youths proud livery so gased on now
will be a tattered weed of small worth held
then being asked where all thy beauty lies
where all the treasure of thy lusty days
to say within thine own deep sunken eyes
were an alleating shame and thriftless praise
how much more praise deserved thy beautys use
if thou couldst answer this fair child of mine
shall sum my count and make my old excuse
proving his beauty by succession thine
  this were to be new made when thou art old
  and see thy blood warm when thou feelst it cold

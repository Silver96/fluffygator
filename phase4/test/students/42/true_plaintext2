                    46

mine eye and heart are at a mortal war
how to divide the conquest of thy sight
mine eye my heart thy pictures sight would bar
my heart mine eye the freedom of that right
my heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie
a closet never pierced with crystal eyes
but the defendant doth that plea deny
and says in him thy fair appearance lies
to side this title is impanelled
a quest of thoughts all tenants to the heart
and by their verdict is determined
the clear eyes moiety and the dear hearts part
  as thus mine eyes due is thy outward part
  and my hearts right thy inward love of heart

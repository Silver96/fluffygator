when in disgrace with fortune and mens eyes
i all alone beweep my outcast state
and trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries
and look upon my self and curse my fate
wishing me like to one more rich in hope
featured like him like him with friends possessed
desiring this mans art and that mans scope
with what i most enjoy contented least
yet in these thoughts my self almost despising
haply i think on thee and then my state
like to the lark at break of day arising
from sullen earth sings hymns at heavens gate
  for thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings
  that then i scorn to change my state with kings

unthrifty loveliness why dost thou spend
upon thy self thy beautys legacy
natures bequest gives nothing but doth lend
and being frank she lends to those are free
then beauteous niggard why dost thou abuse
the bounteous largess given thee to give
profitless usurer why dost thou use
so great a sum of sums yet canst not live
for having traffic with thy self alone
thou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive
then how when nature calls thee to be gone
what acceptable audit canst thou leave
  thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee
  which used lives th executor to be

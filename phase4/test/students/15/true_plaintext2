if there be nothing new but that which is
hath been before how are our brains beguiled
which labouring for invention bear amis
the second burthen of a former child
o that record could with a backward look
even of five hundred courses of the sun
show me your image in some antique book
since mind at first in character was done
that i might see what the old world could say
to this composed wonder of your frame
whether we are mended or whether better they
or whether revolution be the same
  o sure i am the wits of former days
  to subjects worse have given admiring praise

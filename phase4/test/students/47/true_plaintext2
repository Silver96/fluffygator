since brass nor stone nor earth nor boundless sea
but sad mortality oersways their power
how with this rage shall beauty hold a plea
whose action is no stronger than a flower
o how shall summers honey breath hold out
against the wrackful siege of battring days
when rocks impregnable are not so stout
nor gates of steel so strong but time decays
o fearful meditation where alack
shall times best jewel from times chest lie hid
or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back
or who his spoil of beauty can forbid
  o none unless this miracle have might
  that in black ink my love may still shine bright

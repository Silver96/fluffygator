no more be grieved at that which thou hast done
roses have thorns and silver fountains mud
clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun
and loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud
all men make faults and even i in this
authorising thy trespass with compare
my self corrupting salving thy amiss
excusing thy sins more than thy sins are
for to thy sensual fault i bring in sense
thy adverse party is thy advocate
and gainst my self a lawful plea commence
such civil war is in my love and hate
  that i an accessary needs must be
  to that sweet thief which sourly robs from me

like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore
so do our minutes hasten to their end
each changing place with that which goes before
in sequent toil all forwards do contend
nativity once in the main of light
crawls to maturity wherewith being crowned
crooked eclipses gainst his glory fight
and time that gave doth now his gift confound
time doth transfix the flourish set on youth
and delves the parallels in beautys brow
feeds on the rarities of natures truth
and nothing stands but for his scythe to mow
  and yet to times in hope my verse shall stand
  praising thy worth despite his cruel hand
